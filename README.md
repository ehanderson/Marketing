This application has been created for a Kellogg Marketing Project.

The request was to write an app that will gather social media data based around
commercial marketing. In this case, companies that hope to benefit from the
extremely expensive superbowl adds.

This app scrapes data regarding 36 brands on several sites every three hours:

Facebook: 'likes' and 'talking about'
Topsy: setiment score
YouTube SuperBowl Commerical Teasers: views
YouTub SuperBowl Commercial: views

TO USE THIS APP-
  YOU MUST HAVE FIREFOX INSTALLED ON YOUR COMPUTER!!!
  I am working to fix this issue but currently, it will not run without it.

Challanges included:
 - Finding the right gems that would allow for https viewing
 - Understanding Watir and then realizing heroku does not support it
 - Researching Phantomjs and Machanize and seeing when where and for what it can be used
 - The use of Nokogiri while using other gems
 - Understing the use of Typhoeus
 - Setting up workers to run data fetching tasks
